# exposurea analysis labs

This repository contains structured security assessment lab projects focused on understanding external exposure and defensive visibility.

All testing was performed in controlled lab environments for educational purposes.

---

## Asset Visibility Lab
Python-based automation for validating:
- Host availability
- DNS resolution
- Exposed services
- Ownership information

Purpose: Establish external visibility baseline before vulnerability scanning.

---

## External Exposure Analysis
Nessus-based firewall impact study comparing:
- Firewall enabled
- Firewall disabled

Key Insight:
Unauthenticated scans reflect only externally visible attack surface.

---

## Service Detection Automation
Custom Nmap Scripting Engine lab for:
- Service version detection
- Web service identification
- Surface inventory improvement

---

These projects demonstrate structured defensive security thinking and exposure validation methodology.
